 **P**ython3.7 **O**fficial **W**ebsite **T**utorial with **C**hinese **T**ranslation. This job can be regarded as both a review of English and programming for me, that's just killing two birds with one stone. (Original source is from *[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/)*)
 
 It's necessary to be reminded is that the translation of the original website in Simplified Chinese is below the paragraph in **double hashtags**,
 and my own translation is in **double brackets**.
 
It is obvious that there are a lot of errors and inappropriateness in my translation.

In summary, it is just a record of my own personal study, but it may also help you.
